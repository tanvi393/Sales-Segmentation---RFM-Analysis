# RFM Analysis Power BI Report

## 📌 Project Overview

This report focuses on performing **RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis** on sales data to better understand customer behavior. The goal of this analysis is to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention, targeting strategies, and overall business performance.

RFM analysis is a well-known marketing technique that evaluates customers based on:

* **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase
* **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes a purchase
* **Monetary (M):** How much money a customer spends

Using these three factors, businesses can identify their most valuable customers, inactive customers, and those with potential for reactivation.
